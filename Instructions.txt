Insert into laptop and power on
Once at the Windows Setup screen, press Shift+F10
Command Prompt should now appear
Enter powershell
It should now have switched from cmd to ps1

Scripts are disabled by default. Run this to get around it:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process

Navigate to the thumb drive - cd D:\
Run the script - .\Get-AutopilotInfo.ps1
The info should appear as a spreadsheet called AutoPilotInfo

After running, revert the execution restriction on scripts:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope Process
